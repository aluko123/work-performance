# RAG System Improvements for Faithfulness & Grounding

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive improvements to reduce hallucinations and ensure RAG responses are faithful, true to questions, and grounded in context.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Prompts with Strict Grounding Rules** ✅
- Added 7 critical grounding rules in system prompt:
  - Only use explicit information from citations/aggregates
  - No external knowledge or assumptions
  - Explicit handling when data is insufficient
  - Every claim must be traceable to citations
  - Use exact quotes/paraphrases from source
  - Reference specific numbers from aggregates
  - Never generalize beyond data

### 2. **Improved Context Presentation** ✅
- Restructured user prompt with clear sections:
  - "AVAILABLE DATA" section separates aggregates and citations
  - "INSTRUCTIONS" section reinforces grounding requirements
  - Emphasizes citations are verbatim from database
  - Requires referencing specific data points (speakers, dates, scores)

### 3. **Citation Enforcement** ✅
- Updated metadata system to only include actually-used citations
- Added validation that source_ids reference real citations
- Empty list if no citations support the answer
- Ensures bullets and metrics are grounded in citations

### 4. **Document Relevance Filtering** ✅
- Added filtering in `retrieve_docs()`:
  - Checks documents have meaningful content (>50 chars)
  - Validates source_id exists
  - Fallback to top 3 docs if all filtered out
- Prevents low-quality context from polluting answers

### 5. **Improved Retrieval Parameters** ✅
- Enhanced MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance):
  - Set `lambda_mult=0.7` for balanced relevance vs diversity
  - Keeps `k=8` results with `fetch_k=40` initial candidates
  - Prioritizes relevant documents over diverse ones

### 6. **Answer Verification Step** ✅
- New `verify_faithfulness()` function:
  - Checks if answer is fully supported by citations
  - Identifies unsupported claims
  - Returns confidence score (0-1)
  - Adds warnings to metadata for low-confidence answers
- Non-blocking: failures don't stop the pipeline
- Verification metadata includes:
  - `faithfulness_warning`: boolean flag
  - `unsupported_claims`: list of problematic statements
  - `faithfulness_confidence`: float score

### 7. **Lower Temperature for Determinism** ✅
- Reduced LLM temperature from 0.2 to 0.1
- Produces more consistent, grounded responses
- Less creative divergence from source material

### 8. **Integrated Verification into Graph** ✅
- Added "verify" node to LangGraph pipeline
- Flow: load_history → classify → retrieve → aggregate → draft → **verify** → format → save_history
- Works for both sync (`run()`) and async streaming (`astream_run()`)

## Files Modified

1. **backend/prompts/rag.py**
   - Enhanced `answer_system()` with 7 grounding rules
   - Improved `answer_user_template()` with structured data sections
   - Strengthened `metadata_system()` for citation accuracy
   - Added `verification_system()` and `verification_user_template()`

2. **backend/prompts/__init__.py**
   - Exported new verification functions

3. **backend/rag_graph.py**
   - Updated `build_retriever()` with lambda_mult parameter
   - Enhanced `retrieve_docs()` with relevance filtering
   - Added `verify_faithfulness()` function
   - Modified `format_answer()` to include verification metadata
   - Integrated verification into graph workflow
   - Lowered LLM_TEMPERATURE to 0.1

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Strict rules prevent LLM from adding unsupported information
2. **Better Citation Tracking**: Only relevant citations are included in responses
3. **Higher Quality Context**: Filtering ensures meaningful documents reach the LLM
4. **Transparency**: Verification warnings alert users to low-confidence answers
5. **Consistency**: Lower temperature produces more deterministic responses

## Testing Recommendations

Test with questions that typically cause hallucinations:
- Questions with insufficient data
- Questions requiring external knowledge
- Questions about specific metrics/speakers not in context
- Questions with ambiguous or vague phrasing

Check for:
- Answers explicitly state "data does not contain information" when appropriate
- Citations are accurate and traceable
- No generic advice or external knowledge
- Metrics referenced with specific numbers
- `faithfulness_warning` flags when appropriate

## Configuration

To adjust verification strictness, modify in `verify_faithfulness()`:
```python
if not verification.get("is_faithful", True) or verification.get("confidence", 1.0) < 0.7:
    # Lower threshold (e.g., 0.5) for stricter warnings
```

To disable verification (for performance), remove the "verify" node from graph or comment out the step.

## Performance Impact

- **Latency**: +1 LLM call per query for verification (~200-500ms)
- **Cost**: Minimal (~$0.0001 per verification with gpt-4o-mini)
- **Benefit**: Significantly reduced hallucinations and increased user trust

## Next Steps

1. Monitor verification metadata in production
2. Collect metrics on faithfulness_confidence distribution
3. Fine-tune relevance filtering thresholds based on real queries
4. Consider adding semantic similarity scoring for retrieved docs
5. Implement user feedback loop for false positives/negatives
