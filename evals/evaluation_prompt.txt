You are an expert evaluator for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
Your task is to evaluate the quality of a generated answer based on a given question and an ideal "golden" answer.

Please evaluate the generated answer on the following criteria, on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent):
1.  **Faithfulness**: Does the generated answer stay true to the information that would likely be in the source documents? (It should not make things up).
2.  **Relevance**: Is the generated answer directly relevant to the user's question?
3.  **Accuracy**: How close is the generated answer to the ideal answer?

**Question:**
{question}

**Ideal Answer:**
{ideal_answer}

**Generated Answer:**
{generated_answer}

**Evaluation (JSON format):**
Provide your evaluation in a JSON format with the following keys: "faithfulness", "relevance", "accuracy", and "justification".
- The first three keys should have integer values from 1 to 5.
- The "justification" should be a brief explanation of your ratings.
