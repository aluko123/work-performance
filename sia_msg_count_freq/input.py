6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent — we’ll see how that data compares to last week. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass are solid. My fastener staging change seemed to shave 3–4 seconds per cycle Friday. I’ll help demo that today and see who else can benefit."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Great — let’s build that into the broader improvement flow. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety’s green. Today I’m watching for ergo slips — people leaning, twisting, or skipping tool resets under time pressure. I’ll coach on that as I move station to station."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Thanks, Tasha. Let’s make this week about reinforcement, not rework.
Lock in what’s working


Teach it to others

6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning, Jordan. My demo went well — I got three follow-up questions on bin placement, so I think it hit. I’ll shadow Station 2 today to support their turn."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Awesome. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:

6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect use of experience. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. Audit shows faster layouts haven’t hurt inspection yet — in fact, fewer reposition moves. Today I’ll clock and observe flow at Stations 2 and 5 during training."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent — let’s see if the benefit holds when others adopt. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass solid. I’ll help Station 3 refine the new part shelf location they piloted — it reduced search time, but we may need to tweak mounting height."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Smart iteration — keep the improvement moving. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Still no incidents. I’m shadowing repetitive motion at Stations 2 and 5 today. Reminder:
Reset fingers every few cycles


Avoid locking your elbow during repeat torques


Speak up if anything feels off."


6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent. Everyone —
Peer demos are about clarity, not speed


Don’t skip good posture for the sake of pace


Capture any change that’s helping and log it

 "Good morning, Torque Five — we’ve now completed a full round of peer-led best practice coaching. Today is about reviewing what stuck, what helped, and what’s next. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. Tool flow feels easier now with the new layout. I’ll watch for any cable drift today — that’s one thing I haven’t fully rechecked since the bin moved."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Good call — ergonomics includes flow and safety. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are running smooth. I noticed my elbow stays tucked a lot more now that the belt tray is repositioned — I didn’t realize how much I was reaching until I didn’t have to."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Exactly the kind of learning we want. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. Survey results show high confidence in demo value — 92% said they picked up something new. Today I’ll finalize the improvement list and start rough-drafting a new SOP sheet."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect. Let’s lock in what worked. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass are steady. I’m watching for any signs of rebound fatigue — we moved faster this week, but I want to make sure we didn’t overcorrect."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate the check-in. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. No safety issues, but I’ll be doing some spot coaching on posture drift — especially mid-shift. The biggest mistake is assuming new habits are already locked in. They aren’t yet."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Right. Repetition is how we make it stick. So today:
Observe without pushing


Confirm what needs to be repeated


And flag any drift early


6:37 AM — Jordan:

 "Morning, Torque Five — today we start walking the draft SOPs built from your peer demo and audit learnings. These aren’t just documents — they’re a reflection of what you made better. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. My bin layout tweak is already helping the new guy who’s shadowing me this week. Less reach, smoother transitions. I’ll preview the SOP text at first break with him."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect — real-time review with someone still learning is gold. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are flowing. I saw the SOP draft for belt height position and it’s spot-on. I’ll try the callout format with the next trainee so they start clean."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate that. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll walk through SOP drafts at Stations 2 and 5 today — validating each against what’s actually happening live. If it doesn’t match, it doesn’t go live."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Exactly. The floor writes the truth, not the desk. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass are stable. The revised part shelf position SOP is a big help — I’ll test the quick-reach sequence on a few newer folks today to confirm it’s repeatable."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Great — repeatability is the key metric. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety is clean, and I’ll stay alert as people try to adjust to the new. When we rewrite the work, our bodies need a few days to catch up. I’ll monitor shoulder loading and twist angles at Stations 3 & 5."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect. So today:
Draft SOPs walk-throughs by station


Confirm reality matches instruction


Catch any subtle posture shifts as people transition

 "Love to hear it. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll finalize the SOP deck for print today. Every station’s signed off except Station 3, and that’s just pending Carlos’s final shelf angle feedback."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent — we’ll wrap that by lunch. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass are good. I’ll adjust the shelf tilt slightly and if it holds posture and access better, we’ll lock it in. Then we’re ready to stamp it."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect. Let’s close it strong. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. No injuries again. I’ll shadow first hour for posture integrity and shoulder control now that everyone’s following new SOPs. We’ve done the hard part — now we stick to it."

 "Morning. I’m seeing clean cycles, but one bin lid is too stiff to open without shifting posture. I’ll log that for CI. Everything else is locking in nice and steady."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Good eye — small friction is the first place drift starts. Devon?"

 Location: Near Station 1 (Instrument Panel Installation)
 Time: 6:30 AM Central Time

6:30 AM — Jordan (Team Leader):
 "Good morning, Torque Five — it’s Thursday and SOP updates held up great on Day 1. Now we see what happens under pressure. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. The new bin lid angle continues to help, but I noticed one bin rubs a cable during full reach. I’ll work with Materials on clearance."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Good flag — small frictions matter more over time. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are solid. I saw one teammate start to revert to their old hand position under fatigue around Unit 160 — coached it gently and they snapped right back."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Great catch. That’s exactly when bad habits creep in. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’m tracking cycle data on the SOP change zones. So far, 2–3 second reductions per station just from reduced reach or lift effort. That adds up fast."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "That’s gold — we’ll capture that in next week’s CI review. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass smooth. I’ll shadow peer coaching today — listening for what clicks and where folks still need reinforcement."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate the ear on the floor. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety clear. Today I want to reinforce recovery form — when people feel behind, they cut corners. I’ll coach on good resets mid-shift."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Smart. Everyone, remember:
It’s not about catching up


It’s about staying centered


Let’s finish strong today and hold the form


6:37 AM — Jordan:
 "Top 3 Focus Items:
 1️⃣ Observe SOP integrity under sustained cycles
 2️⃣ Encourage peer coaching during fatigue points
 3️⃣ Validate motion savings from updated layouts
Go & See Focus: I’ll shadow Maya for data tracking and join Carlos for live coaching prompts at Stations 2 & 5."
6:38 AM — Jordan:
 "Keep the pace and hold the posture — let’s lock it in, Torque Five."

6:30 AM — Jordan (Team Leader):
 "Happy Friday, Torque Five — we close Week 7 today with all SOP updates live, proven, and owned by you. Let’s keep it tight and clean. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. Station 1 still solid. That bin cable rub I flagged got fixed late yesterday — they added a foam buffer. I’ll confirm it holds through first 20 units."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Nice. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are ready. I’ll run a mini recap session today with one teammate on torque posture — just a quick review to seal in what we practiced this week."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll finalize the SOP metrics summary today — we clocked a 14% reduction in unnecessary motion across revised stations. That’s solid."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Fantastic — we’ll use that Monday in the CI huddle. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass are clean. I’ll support Station 3’s end-of-week checklist review — we’ll verify the new shelf height hasn’t caused any late-cycle reach strain."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate the follow-through. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety’s green. I’ll do one final round of mid-shift reset coaching. Even if it’s Friday, we finish clean, no shortcuts."

🚩 Morning Standup Meeting — Team Torque Five
 Location: Near Station 1 (Instrument Panel Installation)
 Time: 6:30 AM Central Time

6:30 AM — Jordan (Team Leader):
 "Morning and welcome to Week 8, Torque Five. Last week we executed. This week, we build on it. CI board’s up and our mission is clear: document savings, pick our next improvement, and stay sharp. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. I’ll start revalidating the safety checklist at Station 1 — especially around wrist alignment now that bin positions changed. No pain is good news, but let’s confirm."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect — don’t assume, prove it. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are up. I’m nominating seatback clip prep as our next CI — it’s the slowest motion left, and it hasn’t been touched since spring."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent callout. Let’s gather some time trials on it. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll update the CI board and start motion savings mapping from the SOPs. The team saved an average of 6–8 seconds per station per cycle last week — we need to turn that into a $ number."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Love it — visible wins drive belief. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass steady. I’ll coach on clean part handoffs this morning — some slight hesitation during transfers on Friday. Could be a new rhythm issue."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate the catch — good handoffs = smooth flow. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety’s good. I’ll verify checklist match at Station 5, and coach on low-back stance — saw a few slow bends creeping in again late Friday."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Thanks. Everyone — we’re in a great spot, but this is when you level up or drift back. Choose progress. Let’s:
Lock in savings


Identify the next break-through


Coach like it’s Day 1 again


6:37 AM — Jordan:
 "Top 3 Focus Items:
 1️⃣ CI board refresh + identify new improvement targets
 2️⃣ Safety checklist validation with posture focus
 3️⃣ Translate layout gains into measurable impact
Go & See Focus: I’ll rotate with Maya and Rosa on CI board updates and checklist spot checks."
6:38 AM — Jordan:
 "Week 8 starts with clarity and energy — thanks, Torque Five. Let’s go lead again."

 "Good morning, Torque Five — our Week 8 CI momentum continues. First idea trial starts today, and checklist validation wraps up. Let’s keep the flow. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. Checklist at Station 1 is clean — bin updates didn’t introduce any new strain points. I’ll support Station 2 with setup for the new clip prep trial today."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are good. Today I’ll time trial the new seatback clip setup. Should shave 5–7 seconds if we load it staggered instead of stacked. We’ll test it and see."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent — let the data tell the story. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll track the time deltas on the trial and plug them into our cost conversion tool. Also finishing checklist reviews at Stations 2 and 3 this morning."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Awesome. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass running clean. I’ll validate Station 4’s checklist with the team this morning and coach clean entry motion — one teammate had some hesitation we need to smooth."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Great catch — motion integrity matters. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety is green. I’ll close the checklist loop at Station 4 and double-check stance habits at 2 and 3 during the CI trial. No point improving speed if we compromise posture."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Exactly. So, team:
Today we test


Today we verify


Today we document truth, not assumptions


6:37 AM — Jordan:
 "Top 3 Focus Items:
 1️⃣ Seatback clip CI trial at Station 2
 2️⃣ Complete safety checklist validation plant-wide

 Location: Near Station 1 (Instrument Panel Installation)
 Time: 6:30 AM Central Time

6:30 AM — Jordan (Team Leader):
 "Morning, Torque Five — solid results from the seatback clip CI trial. 6.4 seconds shaved per unit adds up fast. Today we validate consistency and plan what’s next. Rosa?"
6:31 AM — Rosa:
 "Morning. I walked the clip trial yesterday and helped two teammates tweak their hand motion slightly — the new prep’s working, but we need to keep the finger spacing safe."
6:32 AM — Jordan:
 "Good reminder — faster isn’t better if it strains. Devon?"
6:32 AM — Devon:
 "Seats are prepped. We’ll run the new prep as standard today and I’ll monitor cycle-to-cycle timing to see if we dip as people get tired. Still feels smoother overall."
6:33 AM — Jordan:
 "Perfect — rhythm under load matters. Maya?"
6:33 AM — Maya:
 "Morning. I’ll calculate the monthly gain if we sustain that 6.4-second reduction. Also starting survey for our second CI target — most early votes are leaning toward Station 3 fastener sequencing."
6:34 AM — Jordan:
 "Excellent — we’ll decide by shift end. Carlos?"
6:34 AM — Carlos:
 "Doors and glass good. I’ll shadow Station 3 this morning to see what the pain points really are in the fastener setup — we’ve had timing gaps there before."
6:35 AM — Jordan:
 "Appreciate the ground view. Tasha?"
6:35 AM — Tasha:
 "Morning. Safety clean. Today I’ll focus on safe hand positions during the new prep flow. No finger tucks, no overreach. And I’ll review Station 3’s motions too since it’s likely next."
6:36 AM — Jordan:
 "Right. Let’s validate what’s working and set up the next win.
Confirm consistency


Quantify the gain


Define our next trial clearly
